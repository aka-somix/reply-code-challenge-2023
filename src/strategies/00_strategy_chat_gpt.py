"""
For each snake, try to place it on each cell of the grid and simulate its movement to cover as many relevant components as possible. Keep track of the cells covered by each snake.
If the snake cannot be placed on a cell without overlapping with another snake, skip that cell.
If the snake covers a cell that has already been covered by another snake, skip that cell.
If the snake covers a network switch, teleport it to the other switch and continue its movement.
